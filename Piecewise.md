# Piecewise Learning Rate Schedule

This repository provides a simple implementation and visualization of a piecewise learning rate schedule, commonly used in training Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).

## Overview

A piecewise learning rate schedule defines the learning rate as a series of constant values over specific intervals (e.g., epochs or iterations) during the training process. The learning rate changes abruptly at the boundaries of these intervals. This strategy can be beneficial for:

* **Faster Initial Convergence:** Using a larger learning rate at the beginning can help the optimization process quickly explore the parameter space.
* **Better Fine-Tuning:** Reducing the learning rate in later stages allows for more precise convergence to a local minimum and can prevent overshooting.
* **Escaping Local Minima:** Well-timed drops in the learning rate can sometimes help the optimizer escape shallow local minima.

This repository includes:

* A Python function to define a sample piecewise learning rate schedule.
* Scripts using Matplotlib and NumPy to visualize this schedule in 2D and conceptually in 3D.

## Files

* `piecewise_lr.py`: Contains the Python code for defining and visualizing the piecewise learning rate schedule.

## Usage

1.  **Clone the repository (optional):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd piecewise-learning-rate-schedule
    ```

2.  **Run the Python script:**
    ```bash
    python piecewise_lr.py
    ```

    This will generate two Matplotlib plots:
    * A 2D plot showing the learning rate as a function of the training step.
    * Conceptual 3D plots illustrating the learning rate in relation to the training step and a simplified parameter space.

## Example Piecewise Learning Rate Schedule

The `piecewise_lr.py` script defines the following example schedule:

| Training Steps (Epochs/Iterations) | Learning Rate |
| :--------------------------------- | :------------ |
| 0 - 49                             | 0.1           |
| 50 - 99                            | 0.05          |
| 100 - 149                           | 0.01          |
| 150+                               | 0.005         |

You can easily modify the `piecewise_lr_schedule` function in the `piecewise_lr.py` file to implement your own custom schedule.

## Visualizations

The script generates the following visualizations:

* **2D Plot:** Shows the learning rate on the y-axis and the training step (epochs or iterations) on the x-axis. The piecewise constant nature of the schedule is clearly visible as a step function.

* **Conceptual 3D Plots:**
    * One plot visualizes the learning rate as the height over a simplified 2D parameter space, conceptually showing how different learning rates might be applied in different regions of the parameter space.
    * Another plot shows the learning rate as the height over the training steps, providing a 3D perspective of the 2D step function.

**Note:** The 3D visualizations are simplified conceptual representations, as the actual parameter space of a neural network is typically much higher dimensional.

## Dependencies

* Python 3.x
* NumPy (`pip install numpy`)
* Matplotlib (`pip install matplotlib`)

## How to Implement in Your ANN Model

To use a piecewise learning rate schedule in your ANN training, you would typically integrate it into your training loop using a deep learning framework like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras. Here's a general idea of how you might implement it:

```python
# Example using a hypothetical training loop

def get_learning_rate(step):
    if step < initial_epochs:
        return initial_lr
    elif step < mid_epochs:
        return mid_lr
    else:
        return final_lr

optimizer = your_optimizer(learning_rate=0.1) # Initial learning rate (can be a placeholder)
global_step = 0

for epoch in range(total_epochs):
    for batch in dataloader:
        # ... perform training step ...
        current_lr = get_learning_rate(global_step)
        for param_group in optimizer.param_groups: # For PyTorch
            param_group['lr'] = current_lr
        # For TensorFlow/Keras, you might use a LearningRateSchedule callback
        # or manually update the optimizer's learning rate.

        optimizer.step()
        global_step += 1

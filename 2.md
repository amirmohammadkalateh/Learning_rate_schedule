Learning Rate Schedules in Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
Learning rate schedules are techniques used to adjust the learning rate during the training of neural networks, helping to improve model performance and convergence. Here's a detailed explanation:

What is a Learning Rate Schedule?
A learning rate schedule is a method that systematically adjusts the learning rate (α) during training, rather than keeping it constant. The learning rate determines how much we adjust the model's weights with respect to the loss gradient.

Why Use Learning Rate Schedules?
Faster convergence: Optimal learning rates can speed up training

Better final performance: Helps find better minima

Avoid overshooting: Prevents bouncing around the optimum

Fine-tuning: Allows smaller adjustments as training progresses

Common Learning Rate Schedule Types
1. Constant Learning Rate
Simplest approach

Learning rate remains fixed throughout training

Often used as baseline for comparison

2. Step Decay
Reduces learning rate by a factor after a set number of epochs

Example: Halve the learning rate every 10 epochs

Formula: α = α₀ * γ^floor(epoch/step_size)

3. Exponential Decay
Continuous exponential decrease

Formula: α = α₀ * e^(-k*t) where t is epoch or iteration

Provides smooth reduction

4. Time-Based Decay
Similar to exponential but with different formulation

Formula: α = α₀ / (1 + k*t)

5. Polynomial Decay
Decreases according to a polynomial function

Formula: α = (α₀ - α_end) * (1 - t/t_max)^p + α_end

6. Cosine Annealing
Uses a cosine function to decrease and then restart learning rate

Helps escape local minima

Formula: α = α_min + 0.5*(α_max - α_min)(1 + cos(t/T_maxπ))

7. Cyclical Learning Rates
Oscillates between bounds with a periodic function

Two types: triangular or sinusoidal

Can help escape saddle points

8. Warmup Schedules
Gradually increases learning rate at start

Helps stabilize early training

Often combined with other schedules

9. Adaptive Methods (Not strictly schedules)
Adam, RMSprop, Adagrad adjust learning rates per parameter

Still may benefit from scheduling

Implementation Considerations
Initial learning rate: Should be large enough to make progress but not cause divergence

Decay rate: How aggressively to reduce learning rate

Schedule timing: When to make adjustments (per epoch/batch/iteration)

Monitoring: Track loss/accuracy to validate schedule effectiveness

Choosing a Schedule
For simple problems: Constant or step decay may suffice

For complex problems: Cosine annealing or warmup+decay often perform well

When unsure: Try several and compare validation performance

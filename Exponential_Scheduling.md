# Exponential Scheduling

This repository contains a Python implementation and visualization of exponential scheduling using the `numpy` and `matplotlib` libraries. Exponential scheduling is a technique where a value decreases exponentially over time, often used in machine learning for learning rate decay, exploration-exploitation trade-offs, and other scenarios where a gradual reduction is desired.

## Overview

This project provides:

-   A Python function (`exponential_scheduling`) to generate a sequence of values following an exponential decay.
-   A 2D visualization of the exponential scheduling using `matplotlib`.
-   A 3D visualization (for illustrative purposes) of the exponential scheduling using `matplotlib`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.x
-   NumPy (`pip install numpy`)
-   Matplotlib (`pip install matplotlib`)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your-username>/exponential-scheduling.git
    ```
    (Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username)

2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd exponential-scheduling
    ```

### Usage

You can run the `exponential_scheduling_viz.py` script directly to generate and visualize the scheduling:

```bash
python exponential_scheduling_viz.py
```

This will open two separate windows displaying the 2D and 3D visualizations of the exponential scheduling with default parameters.

You can also import and use the `exponential_scheduling` function in your own Python projects:

```python
from exponential_scheduling_viz import exponential_scheduling

initial_value = 1.0
decay_rate = 0.1
num_points = 50

time, values = exponential_scheduling(initial_value, decay_rate, num_points)

print("Time:", time)
print("Values:", values)
```

## Code Description

-   **`exponential_scheduling_viz.py`**: This file contains the main implementation and visualization code.
    -   **`exponential_scheduling(initial_value, decay_rate, num_points)`**: Generates an array of values based on the exponential decay formula:
        $$ \text{value}(t) = \text{initial\_value} \times e^{-\text{decay\_rate} \times t} $$
    -   **`visualize_exponential_scheduling_2d(time, values, initial_value, decay_rate)`**: Creates a 2D line plot showing the scheduled values over time.
    -   **`visualize_exponential_scheduling_3d(time, values, initial_value, decay_rate)`**: Creates a 3D line plot (where the third dimension is arbitrary for visualization) to illustrate the concept in a higher-dimensional space.
    -   The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block demonstrates how to use the functions with example parameters.

## Parameters

The `exponential_scheduling` function accepts the following parameters:

-   **`initial_value` (float)**: The starting value at time $t=0$.
-   **`decay_rate` (float)**: The rate at which the value decreases. A higher decay rate leads to a faster decrease. Should be a non-negative value.
-   **`num_points` (int)**: The total number of time steps or points to generate in the schedule.

## Visualizations

The script generates two visualizations:

-   **2D Plot**: Shows the value on the y-axis and the time step on the x-axis. This clearly illustrates the exponential decrease over time.
-   **3D Plot**: Shows the value on the z-axis, the time step on the x-axis, and an arbitrary second dimension (y-axis set to zero) for a 3D representation. This is primarily for conceptual visualization.
